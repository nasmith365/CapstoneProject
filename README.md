# CapstoneProject

Capstone Project for my B.S. in Computer Engineering. Fully functioning robot with the ability to navigate a maze. 
Completed in a group of 4: 
  2 electrical engineers who built the robot and made sure all the components worked together. 
  2 Computer Engineers (including myself) who did all the programming and collabrated with the EE to get the design specs.

Programmed in AVR Studio using C.
